# C) Run the static analysis and discuss the coverage values on the SonarQube dashboard (how many lines are “not covered”? And how many conditions? Are the values good?...)

Coverage values: 74.2%
Lines to cover: 31

Most of the lines not covered are getters, setters and the default main method. All conditions of the code are covered, despite the bellow 80% coverage, the values are good.
