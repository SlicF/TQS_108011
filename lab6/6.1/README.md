| -------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Code Smell (Major)*3 | Invoke method(s) only conditionally.                                                                             | Add a Log Flag and wrap all log statements in a condition to check if the log flag is enabled in the logfunction of DemoMain.java file.                                                                                                                                                                    |
| Code Smell (Major)*2 | Refactor the code in order to not assign to this loop counter from within the loop body.                         | Make the termination condition invariant by using a constant or a local variable instead of an expression that could change during the execution of the loop.<br />If this is impossible and the counter variable must be updated in the loop’s body, use a while or do while loop instead of a for loop. |
| Code Smell (Minor)   | Reorder the modifiers to comply with the Java Language Specification.                                            | Change the order of the public and static statements in EuromillionsDraw.java                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |
| Code Smell (Minor)   | The return type of this method should be an interface such as "List" rather than the implementation "ArrayList". | Replace ArrayList for List  in the constructor of the method findMatchesFor in the EuromllionsDraw.java file                                                                                                                                                                                              |
| Code Smell (Minor)   | Replace the type specification in this constructor call with the diamond operator ("<>").                        | Change ArrayList `<Dip>` results = new ArrayList `<Dip>`(); to ArrayList `<Dip>` results = new ArrayList<>();                                                                                                                                                                                      |
